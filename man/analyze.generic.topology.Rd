\usage{
analyze.generic.topology(chia.obj, output.dir = "output")
}
\arguments{
\item{chia.obj}{A list containing the annotated ChIA-PET data, as returned by \code{\link{annotate.chia}}.}

\item{output.dir}{The name of the directory where to save the graphs.}
}
\description{
Analyzes ChIA-PET data and produces graphs according to the topology of the nodes in the whole set
of regions and in the separated components: \describe{
  \item{Histogram of number of edges.pdf} {Histogram of the number of edges in the whole set of data.}
  \item{Scatter plot of degrees of the left node versus the right node.pdf} {Scatter plot showing the relation between the left and right vertices' degree.}
  \item{Degree vs cluster width.pdf} {A plot of the degree of the nodes in one cluster according to the size of its cluster.}
  \item{Log2(size of component) vs Log2(Number of components).pdf} {A plot of the number of components according to the size of the components.}
  \item{Component table.txt} {A file with the information about TSS for each component.}
  \item{Proportion of TSS in low connectivity nodes.pdf} {A plot of the proportion of TSS in nodes with low connectivity (component with 5 nodes or less).}
