\title{Perform KEGG pathway enrichment on a set of genes.}
\usage{
kegg.enrichment(selected.genes, annotations.list, filename = NULL,
  diseases = FALSE, gene.background = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{selected.genes}{A vector of ENTREZ gene ids to be subjected
to motif enrichment.}

\item{annotations.list}{A list of annotation databases returned by
\code{\link{select.annotations}}.}

\item{filename}{The name of the file where the results should be saved.
If \code{NULL}, results are not saved to disk.}

\item{diseases}{If \code{TRUE}, the enrichment is performed against the disease pathways.}

\item{gene.background}{A list of Entrez gene ids of the genes to be used
as the background of the enrichment. If \code{NULL}, all genes in \code{annotations.list$TxDb}
are used.}
}
\value{
A data-frame with the enrichment results.
}
\description{
Utility function which performs the same operations as \code{\link{motif.enrichment}},
but accepts a list of genes instead of a list of regions.
