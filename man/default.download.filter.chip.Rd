\title{Default filtering function for download.encode.chip.}
\usage{
default.download.filter.chip(query.results, genome.assembly)
}
\arguments{
\item{query.results}{A partial data.frame obtained from the queryEncode
function.The biosample identifier from ENCODE. Valid examples are}

\item{genome.assembly}{Which genome assembly should the results come from?}
}
\value{
A filtered data frame.
}
\description{
The filtering function does three things:
  - It removes all files which do not have the correct genome assembly.
  - It removes broad marks chips, such as histones and Pol II.
  - If the provided results have been re-analyzed by the ENCODE Consortium,
    the ENCODE results are kept and the original ones discarded.
