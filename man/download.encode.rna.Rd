\title{Obtains and process expression data from ENCODE.}
\usage{
download.encode.rna(biosample, assembly,
  download.filter = default.download.filter.rna,
  download.dir = file.path("input/ENCODE", biosample, "rna-seq"))
}
\arguments{
\item{biosample}{The biosample identifier from ENCODE. Valid examples are
GM12878, K562 or MCF-7.}

\item{download.filter}{A filtering function to be applied to the experiment
data-frame returned by queryEncode. The function should return a filtered
data-frame containing only the files which should be downloaded.}

\item{download.dir}{The folder where the downloaded files should be stored.
defaults to file.path("input/ENCODE", biosample, "chip-seq").}
}
\value{
A list containing three elements:
  - Metadata: The metadata returned by queryEncode, containing information 
    about all files which matched the query.
  - Downloaded: The list of files which were downloaded.
  - Expression: A data-frame with processed expression levels.
}
\description{
Given an encode biosample identifier (GM12878, MCF-7, etc.), this function
retrieved processed expression levels.
