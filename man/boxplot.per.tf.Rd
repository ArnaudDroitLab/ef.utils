\name{boxplot.per.tf}
\alias{boxplot.per.tf}
\title{Produces boxplots for every transcription factor, in relation to its 3D connectivity
For every transcription factor in the ChIP data, creates a boxplot of the force of the ChIP-seq signal
in function of the contact frequence of the region.}
\usage{
boxplot.per.tf(chip.data, hist.data, biosample, genome.build, chia.obj,
  output.dir, TSS = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{chip.data}{A \links4class{GRangesList} containing the regions of the ChIp-seq data, with signal values.}

\item{hist.data}{A \links4class{GRangesList} containing the regions of the ChIP-seq data of histone marks.}

\item{biosample}{The biosample identifier from ENCODE. Valid examples are GM12878, K562 or MCF-7.}

\item{genome.build}{The name of the chosen annotation ("hg38", "hg19").}

\item{chia.obj}{Annotated ChIA-PET data, as returned by \link{analyze.chia.pet} or \linl{annotate.chia}.}

\item{output.dir}{The directory where to write the boxplots.}

\item{TSS}{Should only the TSS regions be kept?}
}
