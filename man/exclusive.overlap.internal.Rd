\title{Internal exclusive overlap.}
\usage{
exclusive.overlap.internal(all.regions, overlap.matrix, which.factors)
}
\arguments{
\item{all.regions}{A \linkS4class{GRanges} object with the regions represented}

\item{overlap.matrix}{A matrix, with rows corresponding to regions
in \code{all.rgions}, and columns corresponding to proteins/factors. A
non-zero value in the matrix indicates the protein/factor of interest
is present at this region.}

\item{which.factors}{Indices of columns where the factor should be present.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{GRanges} object with the regions matching the given criteria.
}
\description{
Returns the set of regions within code{all.regions} where all
conditions/proteins at indices which.factors are present,
and no other factors are. Presence/absence at a given locus
is obtained from the \code{overlap.matrix} parameter.
